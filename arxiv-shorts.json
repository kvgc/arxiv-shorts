We estimate that ~5 percent of galaxies could undergo merger events which\noccasionally lead to such prominent structures within the galactic halo during\ntheir lifetime, explaining the low number of observed ORCs. At the time when\nthe shock structures are matching the physical sizes of the observed ORCs, the\ncentral galaxies are typically classified as early-type galaxies, with no\nongoing star formation, in agreement with observational findings. Although the\nenergy released by such mergers could potentially power the observed radio\nluminosity already in Milky-Way-like halos, our predicted luminosity from a\nsimple, direct shock acceleration model is much smaller than the observed one.\nConsidering the estimated number of candidates from our cosmological\nsimulations and the higher observed energies, we suggest that the proposed\nscenario is more likely for halo masses around 1e13 Msol in agreement with the\nobserved stellar masses of the galaxies at the center of ORCs. Such shocks\nmight be detectable with next generation X-ray instruments like the Line\nEmission Mapper (LEM).", "summary": "We investigate shock structures driven by merger events in high-resolution simulations.

To combine LIM experiments probing different\ntracers with traditional galaxy surveys and fully exploit the scientific\npotential of these observations, it is necessary to have a physically motivated\nmodeling framework. As part of developing such a framework, in this work we\nintroduce and model the conditional galaxy property distribution (CGPD), i.e.\nthe distribution of galaxy properties conditioned on the host halo mass and\nredshift. We consider five galaxy properties, including the galaxy stellar\nmass, molecular gas mass, galaxy radius, gas phase metallicity and star\nformation rate (SFR), which are important for predicting the emission lines of\ninterest. The CGPD represents the full distribution of galaxies in the five\ndimensional property space; many important galaxy distribution functions and\nscaling relations, such as the stellar mass function and SFR main sequence, can\nbe derived from integrating and projecting it. We utilize two different kinds\nof cosmological galaxy simulations, a semi-analytic model and the IllustrisTNG\nhydrodynamic simulation, to characterize the CGPD and explore how well it can\nbe represented using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). We find that with just a\nfew ($\\sim 3$) Gaussian components, a GMM can describe the CGPD of the\nsimulated galaxies to high accuracy for both simulations.
