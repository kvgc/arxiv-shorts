Our aim is thus\nto understand novel properties of orbits that are predicted by the latest\nextension of the MOND phenomenology into the relativistic world. We integrated\norbits numerically in a fixed density distribution. The potential required for\nsuch integration was obtained also numerically by assuming different\ngravitational models.

Using\nhighly-sensitive HST/COS and FOS spectra of the Q0107 quasar triplet covering\nLy$\\alpha$ for z$\\lesssim$1, as well as a deep galaxy redshift survey including\nVIMOS, DEIMOS, GMOS and MUSE data, we test simple disk and outflow models\nagainst the H I absorption along three lines-of-sight (separated by 200-500\nkpc) through nine galaxy groups in this field. These can be compared with our\nprevious results in which these models can often be fit to the absorption\naround isolated galaxies. Our models can reproduce $\\approx$ 75$\\%$ of the 28\nidentified absorption components within 500 km/s of a group galaxy, so most of\nthe H I around groups is consistent with a superposition of the CGM of the\nindividual galaxies. Gas stripped in interactions between galaxies may be a\nplausible explanation for some of the remaining absorption, but neither the\ngalaxy images nor the galaxy and absorber kinematics provide clear evidence of\nsuch stripped material, and these unexplained absorbers do not preferentially\noccur around close pairs of galaxies. We find H I column densities typically\nhigher than at similar impact parameters around isolated galaxies ($\\approx$\n2.5$\\sigma$), as well as more frequent detections of O VI than around isolated\ngalaxies (30$\\%$ of sightlines to 7$\\%$).", "summary": "We examine to what extent disk and outflow models can reproduce observations of H I gas within a few virial radii of galaxies in pairs and groups. We find H I column densities typically higher than at similar impact parameters around isolated galaxies. Gas stripped in interactions between galaxies may be a plausible explanation for some of the remaining absorption, but neither the galaxy and absorber kinematics provide clear evidence of such stripped material."}}
